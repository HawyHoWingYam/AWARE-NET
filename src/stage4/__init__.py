Stage 4: Cascade Detection System Integration and Mobile Optimization
====================================================================

This module implements the fourth stage of the cascade deepfake detection system,
focusing on unified cascade integration and mobile deployment optimization.

Key Components:
- Unified cascade detection system (Stage 1 → Stage 2 → Stage 3)
- Dynamic threshold strategies with temperature scaling
- Mobile optimization through QAT + Knowledge Distillation
- Video processing and batch inference capabilities
- Performance benchmarking and deployment testing

Target Performance:
- <200ms per frame on mobile hardware
- >0.95 overall system AUC
- <500MB total memory footprint
- >75% model size reduction
