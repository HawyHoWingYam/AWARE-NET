"""
Stage 5: Final Evaluation & Production Deployment
================================================

This module implements the comprehensive final evaluation framework and production
deployment ecosystem for the AWARE-NET mobile deepfake detection system.

Key Components:
- Master Evaluation Framework: Cross-dataset testing and performance validation
- Production Deployment: Mobile apps, web services, cloud infrastructure
- Monitoring & Observability: Real-time monitoring and alerting systems
- Sustainability Framework: Long-term maintenance and evolution capabilities

Stage 5 transforms the research prototype into an enterprise-grade production system
ready for real-world deployment at scale.
